  "rdfs:comment": "Ran Bubble stove overnight to heat water and warm boat.  Full power for 5 hrs, medium for 5 hrs, then low.  Continuous running at low does seem to be effective for keeping the boat warm once the chill and damp have been dispelled.\r\n\r\nFilled up the stove fuel tank:  18\": when full.  65.8 litres taken.\r\n\r\nMercia - Shobnall: 3 hrs\r\n",
