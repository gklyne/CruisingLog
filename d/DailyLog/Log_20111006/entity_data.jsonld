  "rdfs:comment": "Engine failed to start this morning.  Called RCR.  Advised problem may be insufficient charge from alternator (not convinced).  I did notice this evening that turning the engine battery isolator causes a relay to click.  Suggests some battery drain while battery not isolated, if only to hold solenoid.\r\n\r\nCan jump start by connecting +ve domesgtic battery to +ve engine battery (that's what RCR engineer did).  Bought jump leads in Loughborough.\r\n\r\nDisconnected starter battery when moored.\r\n",
