  "rdfs:comment": "Total capacity about 12 litres\r\n\r\nAir bleed points on radiators and drain point behind Bubble stove.\r\n\r\nCirculating pump below front step (alongside water pump).\r\n\r\nNOTE: the expansion tank in the hot water circuit is *below* the highest point in the circuit.  Therefore it must be unclipped and lifted when filling/bleeding the circuit.  Also, if there is an air leak, water level in the header tank *rises* and may overflow - hence overflow pipe from header to separate container under the rear step.\r\n\r\nThe expansion tank is held on by a rubber strap, which may be unclipped to lift the tank.  Stand it on the hatch door ledge to bring it above other points in the circuit.  Overflow into 5 liter container ensures any loss due to air leak is captured.",
