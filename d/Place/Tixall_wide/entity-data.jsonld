  "rdfs:comment": "A very wide length of canal about a mile South of Great Haywood junction.  Popular mooring spot, with open views.\r\n\r\nDon't arrive too late, or the best mooring spots will be taken.  The bank is low and a bit ropey, and can be rather muddy in places  There are more attractive moorings further South along the canal.\r\n",
