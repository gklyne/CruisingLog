  "rdfs:comment": "A village outside Stoke/Hanley.  A good safe stopping point just outside the Stoke 5-towns, but with limited moorings.  This might be seen as the changeover from the urban Caldon and the more pleasant rural Caldon.  Towards Stoke, after a couple of miles, the canal passes close to some rough estates, concerning which there have been reports of boaters being targeted by local gangs.\r\n\r\nUseful shops about 5 minutes walk.\r\n",
