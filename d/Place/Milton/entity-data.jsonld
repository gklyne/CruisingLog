  "rdfs:comment": "A village outside Stoke/Hanley.  A good safe stopping point just outside the Stoke 5-towns, but with limited moorings.  This might be seen as the changeover from the urban Caldon and the more pleasant rural Caldon.  Towards Stoke, after a couple of miles, the canal passes close to some rough estates, concerning which there have been reports of boaters being targeted by local gangs.\r\n\r\nUseful shops about 5 minutes walk.\r\n\r\nMilton is a very convenient spot for vehicle access, by entrance to Hardman Football Development Centre.\r\n\r\nEnterprise car hire in Hanley do pick-up and drop-off.\r\n",
