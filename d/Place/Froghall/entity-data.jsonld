  "rdfs:comment": "The end of the Churnet Valley arm of the Caldon Canal.\r\n\r\nThe final section is accessed by a low-roofed tunnel, which many boats cannot pass.  The approach to Froghall from Consall Forge is by way of a remote wooded valley, also carrying the River Churnet and the Churnet Valley (steam) railway.  The traces of old industry give the place a feel of something out of Myst.\r\n",
