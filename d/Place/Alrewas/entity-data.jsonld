  "rdfs:comment": "A pleasant village, probably the most southerly point on the Trent and Mersey.\r\n\r\nGood moorings in the village, and also just beyond the lock heading towards Fradley.\r\n\r\nShops are about 5-10 minutes walk from the canal.  They include a good butcher (Coates) and a co-op opr similar.  Thgere is a (part-time?) post office [@@check].\r\n\r\nWater point: a short distance above the lock onto the river section.\r\n",
